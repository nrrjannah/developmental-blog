            <p>reflection: this topic required me to remember what i learnt for python but in a different way, it was quite fun to "convert" a coding langauge to another. it is intriguing how everything is applied the same way but just in different formats</p>

            <p>reflection: i think this one was the most fun exercise and topic out of all that has been taught. API seems very challenging and might be hard to get a hang of, but once i get it, i think it will be very fun!</p>
